## 📖 About the Project
This project serves as the dedicated frontend for my personal weather hardware. It was built to solve the need for a clean, ad-free, and hyper-local weather dashboard that provides more granular data than standard weather apps.
The goal was to create a UI that is both aesthetically pleasing and technically robust, utilizing Next.js for speed and Mantine UI for a responsive, modern feel.

- **Data Visualization:** Custom-built charts showing 24-hour trends for temperature, humidiy and pressure.
